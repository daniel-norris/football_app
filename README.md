## Objective
Develop an app with an MVP that enables the user to randomly pick a 5-a-side football team from a list of 10 names.

Further stretch goals could be implemented if time allowed.

## Installation

**Installing the app locally**

    This guide assumes that you have node.js and npm installed. Installing these dependencies are out of scope for this guide but you can refer to the npm docs on how to install these dependencies here.

The app can be installed locally onto your machine by using the following steps.

First, clone the remote repository to your local machine and name the target directory.

```git clone git@github.com:daniel-norris/football_app.git <dir>```

Then cd into the project directory.

```cd <dir>```

Install the dependencies required for the app.

```npm i ```

Run the app.  When this runs you will redirected to http://localhost:3000/#/.

```npm start```

**Installing the API locally**

    This guide assumes that you have both PHP, Composer, Vagrant and MySQL installed. Installation is out of scope for this guide but you can refer to their docs on how to install.

First, clone the remote repository and name the target directory.

```git clone git@github.com:daniel-norris/football_api.git <dir>```

Change directory into folder.

```cd <dir>```

Run Composer to install dependencies.

```composer install```

Make a homestead.yaml file.

```vendor/bin/homestead make```

Copy the example environments variable file and create a new one.

```cp .env.example .env```

Then open the .env file and change the following fields according to your MySQL installation.

```nano .env```

```
DB_DATABASE=<DB name>
DB_USERNAME=<DB username>
DB_PASSWORD=<DB password>
```

Change `homestead.yaml` memory to `512`.

Then spin up a new Vagrant VM.

```vagrant up```

SSH into vagrant, generate a new key and migrate the tables.

```
vagrant ssh
cd code
run artisan key:generate
run artisan migrate
```

    If you choose to run both the app and API locally, then you will need to point the app away from AWS and towards your local Vagrant VM.

Point your local app towards the local instance of your API.

Create an .env file in your app directory using the instructions below.

**Mac OS**

You need to point the React app towards the appropriate URL. You can edit this in the .env file in the root directory.

```REACT_APP_API_URL=http://<laravel url here>/api/```

Then update your .axios file in the root directory.

```baseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL,```

**Win OS**
You need to point the React app towards the appropriate URL. You can edit this in the .env file in the root directory.

```REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/```

Then update your .axios file in the root directory.

```baseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL,```

### Releases Log

**21 Jun 2020 | v 0.1.0.**
- Initial release was planned on the Sunday before the week started. Ironically to avoid wasting any time but this plan would later be shelved over concerns about meeting time deadlines. You can review the original plan in the documentation above.

- Production version plan is included here.
- Plan revised due to concerns about time constraints and database complexity and opted for a “slimmed” down version which I was confident I could deploy in time and with time to spare.
